fpds.gov ezsearch was taken offline on Feb. 24, 2026. SAM.gov replaced it. 

You can use this script to turn old fpds.gov links into the the equivelant SAM.gov url by stripping out the PIID from the former and sticking it in the right place in the latter. 

Annoyingly, you might have to be logged in to SAM.gov to view the same information going forward. 

Minimally tested. Should work for any links with "q=" in url path. Don't get mad at me if it doesn't. please. 

For easiest use, save bookmarklet.js as a bookmark. It shows you a pop up to paste the fpds.gov link into, then converts and opens sam.gov.
